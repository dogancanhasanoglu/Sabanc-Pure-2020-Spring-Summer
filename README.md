Hardware Design for Post-Quantum Cryptography


There is an on-going competition for Post Quantum Cryptography Standardization and hardware performance will be one of the determining factors for this competition. Efficient implementations will be very critical in the near future. Constructions based on Lattice-Based cryptography are looking the most promising at the moment. In this project, students will design and implement mathematical building blocks for lattice based cryptography, targeting various FPGA families.
